# 📅 Development Timeline

*Although we were given four full days to complete this*
- **Limited Development Time:** I completed this task in a tight timeframe of approximately 24 hours because I was, unfortunately, travelling from the USA to India and then having to travel by car for two days. I only had the 16th and the 19th, *20th I'm travelling to my hometown in India.*

# 🌐 Pages Overview
- **Home Page:** Showcases front-end skills with a modern navbar, footer and animated logo display of random companies going side to side, which could be local Egypt/Cairo stores. 
- **Products Page:** Demonstrates successful data fetching and display. Due to time constraints, some planned features couldn't be implemented, including advanced filtering, a functional shopping cart, and a detailed full-sized product modal for users to see more information.
